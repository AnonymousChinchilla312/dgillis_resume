# Overview

This program performs and displays mathematical operations based on user input. Available operations include basic arithmetic, trigonometric operations like sine and cosine, and logarithmic operations like finding the natural log of a number and raising 'e' to a specific power.

I created this software to help myself learn the basics of C++, including getting user input, explicit type conversion, and creating and using functions.

# Development Environment

I used Code::Blocks to develop this code in C++. I used the following libraries: iostream, cctype, cmath, math.h.

# Useful Websites

Some websites that were helpful in developing this project.

# Future Work

These are a few steps to improve this code should I need to:

- Allowing the user to perform math with units of time. (hours, minutes, etc.)
- Allowing the user to use scientific notation with inputs.
- Creating an interface that is more user-friendly.
