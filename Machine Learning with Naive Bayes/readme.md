# Overview

This program implements a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier in Rust to predict data on the iris csv file.

I wrote this program to learn more about both Rust and typical machine learning processes.

# Development Environment

This project was developed using VS Code.

The libraries 'rand' and 'std' were used for this program.

# Future Work

These are a few steps to improve this code should I need to:

- In the future, I would like to implement a way to let the user add new data to the dataset.
- I would also like to add a menu that allows the user to choose to predict a single observation instead of simply displaying the accuracy score for the whole set.
