# Overview

This is a simple demonstration of a game in which the player can use a time machine to cause their character to travel through time. No objectives are implemented yet, this is showing the basic idea. The player uses the mouse to drag the player to move and enter the time machine.

This was a project that I did for fun, and to sharpen my GameMaker coding skills.
