# Overview

This program displays the fibonacci and lucas sequences using Erlang. It can display sequences of a certain length, sequences up to a maximum value, and numbers in specific positions in the sequence.

I created this to teach myself the basics of Erlang, as well as recursion and data types.

# Future Work

These are a few steps to improve this code should I need to:

- Implementing memoization to improve performance time for large numbers.
- Allowing for sequences that expand into the negative numbers as well as positive numbers.
